## Introduction

Detailed splashes are a necessity for high resolution liquid simulations. Modelling large amounts of realistic droplet formation requires the use of very fine spatial discretization due to their complex small scale surface geometry and dynamics. This in turn, leads to very high computational cost, making it challenging to generate vivid splashes in liquid simulations.

## Methodology

Utilize neural networks to learn the small-scale splashes from physically accurate simulations. This will help in approximating the sub-grid scale effects that lead to droplet generations, allowing to produce realistic splashes even in coarse simulations -- significantly reducing the computational cost.
